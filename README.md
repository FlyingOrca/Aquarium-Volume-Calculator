# Aquarium-Volume-Calculator
A simple volume calculator for aquarium/fish tank

Welcome!
This is a simple volume calculator for aquarium/fish tank.
People want to know the correct volume of fish tank before purchasing live stocks, putting additives, or changing water.
Water volume calculation app would be pretty handy for many hobbyists (including myself)

I only put cube/cuboid, cylinder, hexagonal prism, and pentagola prism in version 1.0.
Soon I will add more shapes including bow front, elliptical, and/or other popular shapes.

I am still learning and Java is so attractive!
Please feel free to contact me if you have any inquiry, suggestion, advice, or anything.  :)

Cheers,
